## Kali in Batch

A simulated Kali Linux environment in Batch and PowerShell.

### Dependencies

- [Nmap](https://nmap.org/)
- [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) (make sure you get Git Bash and use a system-wide installation)
- [Vim (optional)](https://www.vim.org/download.php)
- [PowerShell 7+](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases) (or you can get it from Microsoft Store)

### Usage

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://codeberg.org/Kali-in-Batch/kali-in-batch.git
```
```bash	
cd kali-in-batch
```

Then, run `kali_in_batch.bat` inside the src directory.
DO NOT MOVE THE FILE OUTSIDE THE SRC DIRECTORY.
Do not run any of the PowerShell scripts manually, as they require special arguments given by `kali_in_batch.bat`.

Once you have set up Kali in Batch, try installing this package in the Kali in Batch shell:
```bash
pkg install elf-exec
```
This package allows you to execute Linux binaries.
Run it:
```bash
pkg-exec elf-exec
```

### Quick tutorial

#### During the Kali in Batch installer

- Press Windows + R
- Type diskmgmt.msc
- Shrink any drive with any amount of space
- Create a drive in the unallocated space
- Type the drive letter of the new drive in the Kali in Batch installer
- Press Enter
- After this, Kali in Batch should be automatically set up

#### After installation

Try the following commands:

```bash
ls
```
```bash
cd /
```
```bash
cd ~
```
```bash
pwd
```
```bash
ls -l
```
```bash
cd ..
```
```bash
uname -a
```
```bash
whoami
```
```bash
git --version
```
```bash
pkg install hello-world
```
```bash
pkg-exec hello-world
```

These should help you get familiar with the shell. If you're already familiar with Linux shells, only do the package manager commands.
