Contributing to Kali in Batch
=============================
We welcome contributions from the community, but they must follow these guidelines:
* Your code should be tested.
* Your code should follow the style of the rest of the code.
* Your code should have comments documenting what it does.

By contributing, you also agree to the following:
* You will maintain the copyright of your code, meaning you must add a copyright header to your code, whether you are the original author or not.
Example:

rem Copyright (c) 2025 Your Name or the Original Author's Name if included verbatim
rem Licensed under the [something] License.
echo Code
```
* You will not include any code verbatim that is licensed under a viral license, as that requires relicensing the Kali in Batch project.
