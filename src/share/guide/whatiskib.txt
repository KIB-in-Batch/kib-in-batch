Introduction
============

KIB in Batch behaves similarly to a Linux system, but with some differences and additions.
Here you can see what KIB in Batch is and isn't and how it works.

KIB in Batch Is...
===================

A lightweight shell environment providing Linux-like functionality to Microsoft Windows.

KIB in Batch Isn't...
======================

A Linux distro.
A drop-in replacement for Cygwin and Msys. We might try to get there in the future.
A way to run unmodified Linux binaries on Windows. Use WSL for that.

How It Works
============

When you run "kib_in_batch.bat", it sets up the following:

* A root file system
* A virtual drive for the root file system using subst
* Downloads BusyBox to /usr/bin
* Sets up the essential environment variables
* Copies essential binaries and creates essential files and directories, making it structurally similar to a UNIX system
* Launches the BusyBox bash applet with /etc/.kibenv set as the ENV variable

End

There is nothing else to say.
