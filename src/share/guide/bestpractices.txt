Introduction
============

Kali in Batch behaves similarly to a Linux system, but with some differences and additions.
Here you can see the best practices when using Kali in Batch.

File System
===========

1. We recommend you use <drive letter>:/ instead of /, as it is universal and avoid issues when you are in another drive.

    * For example if your chosen drive letter is Z:, do this:

    ---------------------------
    cd Z:/
    ---------------------------

    * And not this:

    ---------------------------
    cd /
    ---------------------------

    * If you forgot your chosen drive letter, do this:

    ---------------------------
    cd $KALIROOT/ # KALIROOT is set to your chosen drive letter
    ---------------------------

Permissions
===========

Unlike a regular Linux system, Kali in Batch does not implement file system restrictions to the non-root user. The only special privilege root has is the ability to manage packages.

That means we absolutely do not recommend to try doing dangerous operations as the non-root user, as you will NOT see any permission denied errors.

By now, you should have learned the best practices when using Kali in Batch.
