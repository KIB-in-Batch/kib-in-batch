Introduction
============

Kali in Batch behaves similarly to a Linux system, but with some differences and additions.
Here you can see how to install and use some common (ethical) hacking or penetration testing commands in Kali in Batch.

Reconnaissance
==============

Kali in Batch automatically installs Nmap, a powerful port scanner that can allow thorough reconnaissance.
Here's an example:

```code
nmap -v -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org # Replace this with the IP or domain you want to do a scan on
```endcode

Nmap comes with Ncat, which can be used for both reconnaissance and post-exploitation.

Follow any additional instructions given by the commands mentioned.

Post-Exploitation
=================

Because Kali in Batch uses BusyBox for the userland, you can use BusyBox nc for a simple reverse shell:

```code
nc -l -p 6969 # Replace this with your preferred port
```endcode

For a more comprehensive reverse shell, you can use Ncat which Nmap comes with:

```code
ncat -l -p 6969 # Replace this with your preferred port
```endcode

I know that is the same command as the nc one, but Ncat has a lot more flags you can use. Just see 'ncat --help' for more info because it has too much to list here.

Follow any additional instructions given by the commands mentioned.

Any Exploitation
================

Kali in Batch comes with an msfconsole wrapper, which is a batch file that uses the Windows Subsystem for Linux to launch the Metasploit Framework.

You can run it just like this:

```code
msfconsole
```endcode

End
