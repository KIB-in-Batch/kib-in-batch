Introduction
============

Kali in Batch behaves similarly to a Linux system, but with some differences and additions.
Here you can see how to install and use some common Linux distro commands in Kali in Batch.

Package Management
==================

Use the "kib-pkg" package manager to install packages. Here's an example (replace example-package with the actual package name):

To synchronize the package list:

```code
kib-pkg update
```endcode

To install a package:

```code
kib-pkg install example-package
```endcode

To remove it:

```code
kib-pkg remove example-package
```endcode

To upgrade it:

```code
kib-pkg upgrade example-package
```endcode

To search for a package:

```code
kib-pkg search example-package
```endcode

To list installed packages:

```code
kib-pkg list
```endcode

Follow any additional instructions given by the package manager.

File Management
===============

You can use the "cd" command to change directories. Here's an example:

```code
cd /path/to/directory
```endcode

You can use the "mkdir" command to create a new directory. Here's an example:

```code
mkdir new-directory
```endcode

You can use the "rm" command to remove a file or directory. Here's an example:

```code
rm file.txt
rm -r directory
```endcode

You can use the "rmdir" command to remove (specifically) a directory. Here's an example:

```code
rmdir directory
```endcode

You can use the "cp" command to copy a file. Here's an example:

```code
cp file.txt new-file.txt
```endcode

You can use the "mv" command to move or rename a file. Here's an example:

```code
mv file.txt new-file.txt
```endcode

Follow any additional instructions given by the commands mentioned.

Software Development
====================

Kali in Batch automatically installs Neovim, but you can use any other text editor on your system.
For example to create main.c using Visual Studio Code:

```code
code main.c
```endcode

To compile main.c using GCC (not installed by Kali in Batch), you can use the following command:

```code
gcc main.c -o main # -o can also be before the file name
```endcode

Follow any additional instructions given by the commands mentioned.

Privilege Escalation
====================

Kali in Batch provides a root user, which unlike the regular user has the ability to manage packages.

```code
Kali in Batch x.y
Kernel x.y.z... on an PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE

Users on this system: USERNAME, root

COMPUTERNAME login:
```endcode

Notice how there is a root user. You can log in as it by just typing "root" in the login field.

If you have already logged in as the regular user, you can use sudo to run a command as the root user:

```code
sudo command # This does not have an interactive shell, use su for that
```endcode

You can also use su if you want an interactive root shell:

```code
su
```endcode

Type unsu once you don't need to be root anymore.

Follow any additional instructions given by the commands mentioned.

End

By now you should have gotten used to Kali in Batch.
